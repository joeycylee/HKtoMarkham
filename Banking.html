        <p>There are different <b>types of banks</b> in Canada.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The main/popular banks (the big 5): TD Canada Trust, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), Scotiabank</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>The good thing about these banks is they have a lot of stores. In Markham, it will be easy to find a teller who speaks Chinese.</li>
                    <li>The bad thing about these banks is you have to pay for many small things. For example, sometimes you have to pay a monthly fee to have an account, or sometimes you need to have a minimum balance (~$4000-$5000) to avoid paying the fee.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Newer, cheaper banks: EQ Bank, Tangerine, Simplii Financial
                <ul>
                    <li>The good thing about these banks give you higher interest rates, are usually free, and have less paperwork.</li>
                    <li>The bad thing about these banks is they do not have stores that you can visit in person (they probably don't have Chinese customer service staff).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>    
        </ul>

        <p><b>Ways to invest:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can invest with any of the big 5 banks. They have their own investment platforms.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The good thing about investing with these banks is it is easy to transfer money in and out different accounts in the same bank. TD is also good for holding US dollars because they have banks in the USA.</li>
                        <li>The bad thing about investing with these banks is you have to pay a lot of fees. They are also harder to use.</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Companies that are only online: Questrade, Wealthsimple
                <ul>
                    <li>The good thing about investing with these companies is you don't have to pay many fees.</li>
                    <li>The bad thing about investing with these companies is they do not have stores that you can visit in person.</li>

        <p>There are three main investment accounts that help you pay less taxes. Inside each account, you can buy and sell investments (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.) to grow your money.</p>
        <p><b>1. Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA)</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can use a TFSA to buy stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc. Or you can keep cash in your TFSA (not a great idea).</li>
            <li>When you grow your money in a TFSA, you do not pay taxes on what you earn (= tax free). This is because you are using money (from a job) that has already been taxed.</li>
            <li>You do not need to earn income to have a TFSA. You can open a TFSA if you are over 18 years old and after getting a Social Insurance Number (SIN).</li>
            <li><b>Contribution limit</b> = the maximum amount that you can add (contribute) to your TFSA</li>
            <li>You can have multiple TFSAs with different banks, but the total of all your TFSAs must be below your contribution limit.</li>
            <li>Rules to follow:
                <ul>
                    <li>Every January 1st, you can contribute more money to your TFSA. The amount can be different every year. In 2023, the contribution limit is $6500. This means you can a maximum of $6500 into your TFSA this year (2023).</li>
                    <li>You can take your money out at any time without paying any fees. If you take money out of your TFSA, you have to wait until the next January 1 to add that amount back. For example, if you take out $1000 in 2023, then on January 1, 2024, you can put in $1000 more than whatever your limit is. <a href = "https://www.moneysense.ca/save/investing/tfsa-contribution-room-calculator/">Here</a> is a calculator to help you understand.</li>
                    <li>Keep track of how much money you put in and take out of your TFSA. Do not add more than your contribution limit! If you do, you will have to pay a very large fine.</li>
                    <li>Any money you earn inside your TFSA does NOT count towards your contribution limit AND you don't have to pay taxes on it. This is GREAT! There's no limit on how much you can have inside your TFSA. You only have a limit on the amount you can ADD.</li>
                    <li>The best things to buy in your TFSA are CANADIAN dividend stocks and ETFs.</li>
                  </ul>
            </li>
        </ul> 

        <p><b>2. Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) - *** We will add more details later ***</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>As a Permanent Resident (PR), you can open a RRSP if you earn an income. But you have to wait until January 1 of next year (2024).</li>
            <li>It is best to use your RRSP as an investment account, not a savings account.</li>
            <li>When you put money in your RRSP, the government (CRA = Canada Revenue Agency) returns the taxes you already paid on this money (from your job). This tax return happens at tax time.</li>
            <li>Two big benefits to having a RRSP:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lets you defer your tax benefits to another year (when you retire)</li>
                  <li>Lets you grow your money without paying taxes now. You will have to pay taxes when you take the money out, which is usually when you retire. When you retire, you pay less taxes because you are not working anymore.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is usually not a good idea to take money out of your RRSP. When you take money out, you have to pay taxes on it because the money is treated like income.</li>
            <li>Analyze the coded data to extract information, such as prevalence of a specific disease or how often an intervention is done</li>
            <li>Contribute to the development of clinical decision support systems by applying natural language processing or machine learning principles</li> 
            <li>Examples of data standards: Canadian Health Outcomes for Better Information and Care (C-HOBIC), International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP), interRAI Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), SNOMED CT</li>
            <li><b>Deduction limit</b> = total available contribution room + unused contributions previous years</li>
            <li>Rules to follow:
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Contribution limit</b> = the amount you are allowed to put in your RRSP</li>
                  <li>Your contribution room depends on your income from last year.</li>
                  <li>If you do not use all your contribution limit, the leftover amount will be added to your contribution room next year.</li>
                  <li>Do not add more than your contribution limit. If you do, you have to pay a fine.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul> 

        <p><b>3. Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>A RESP helps pay for your child's postsecondary education.</li>
          <li>You can open a RESP for your child if they have a SIN.</li>
          <li>A RESP should not be used as a savings account. It should be used as an investment account. You can buy stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc.</li>
          <li>When your investment grows, you do not have to pay taxes on the amount it grows.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Rules to follow when ADDING money to a RESP:
            <ul>
              <li>A RESP must be opened FOR your child.</li>
              <li>The maximum amount YOU can put in your child's RESP is $50,000. If you add more, you will have to pay a fine.</li>
              <li>The government will give you money (Canadian Education Savings Grant = CESG) equal to 20% of the money you put into your child's RESP. This is FREE MONEY! The government will give your child a maximum of $500 per year. Each child can get a lifetime maximum CESG of $7200.
                <ul>
                  <li>Example: If you add $1000, the government adds $200 (20%) for free.</li>
                  <li>The government will not match anything more than $2500, because 20% of $2500 is $500 (the yearly maximum).</li>
                  <li>The government gives even more grants ($50-100 more per year) to families that have income less than $106,717.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>BUT! The government stops matching at the end of the year that your child turns 17. For Eitan, this date is December 2024.</li>
              <li>If you do not add the maximum yearly amount ($2500) to your child's RESP, you can "carry forward" the grant amount you did not get to the next year (up to $1000 grant in one year).
                <ul>
                  <li>Example: During year 1, I added $0 to my child's RRSP. This means I did not get the free $500 government grants. Next year, I want to catch up and put $5000. So the government will give me $500 grants for this year + $500 grants for last year. You can only do this 1 year at a time.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>  
              <li>Use the money in the RESP to buy safe investments. For example, if the stock you bought goes down and you sell it, you will lose that RESP room FOREVER. You cannot put the amount you lost back in the RESP.</li>
              <li>RESP is tax free for Canadian stocks and ETFs (not US). If you invest in US stocks, you must pay taxes on the growth.</li>
              <li>You can keep adding money to your child's RESP until they turn 31. Their money can keep growing without paying taxes.</li>
              <li>You can keep a RESP open for 36 years.</li>
              <li>Canada Learning Bond (CLB) = this program adds $2000 MORE into your child's RESP if the family income is less than $47,000</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Rules to follow when TAKING money out of a RESP:
            <ul>
              <li>A RESP has 3 types of funds that have different rules:
                <ol>
                  <li>Contributions = money YOU put in the RESP
                    <ul>
                      <li>You can take this money out anytime and do whatever you want with it. You do not have to pay taxes on it.</li>
                      <li>The money can go into your child's account or your account (parent).</li>
                      <li>When you take this money out, the withdrawal is called a Postsecondary Education (PSE) payment OR a Refund of Contributions (ROC).</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Grants, including the CESG and CLB
                    <ul>
                      <li>Another name for this free money is called Education Assistance Payments (EAP).</li>
                      <li>Only take this money out when your child is taking postsecondary education inside or outside Canada.</li>
                      <li>This money can only be taken out by the student WHILE they are in school.</li>
                      <li>Try to spend this money BEFORE spending the contributions. You can only spend this money while in school. Contributions can be spent anytime (like after graduation). EAPs are also taxed based on the student's income. Usually students have very low income so this means $0 or very little will be taxed.</li>
                      <li>In 2023, during the student's first 13 weeks of postsecondary education, they can take out a maximum of $8000 of EAP.</li>
                      <li>The student can spend this EAP money on anything they want to.</li>
                      
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>Accumulated income = tax-free growth from the money you put in
                    <ul>
                      <li>Try to spend this money BEFORE spending the contributions. Accumulated income is taxed based on the student's income. Usually students have very low income so this means very little will be taxed.</li>
                      <li>In 2023, the maximum EAP + accumulated income you can take out in one year is $26,860.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We do not recommend Group Plans and Scholarship Plans. These are managed by Fund Managers, so you can't pick what to invest your money in. They also charge high fees and there are limits on withdrawals.</p>
