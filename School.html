        <p><b>Post</b>secondary = <b>after</b> secondary school (high school)</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Undergraduate (undergrad) degree = a degree you get from a university right after high school</li>
            <li>Graduate degrees = degrees you get from a university after getting an undergraduate degree. Graduate degrees are Masters and PhDs.
            <ul>
                <li>To work as a scientist, you need at least a Masters or PhD. If you only have an undergraduate science degree, you can work be a research assistant, work for a consulting company, or other non-science job.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>College is good for jobs that are more hands-on, like carpenter. You can get a job right after graduating from a college.</li>
            <li>University transfer programs = some have agreements or relationships with universities that let students transfer college credits to a degree program, where a student may transfer to, and which courses will apply towards the degree.</li>
            <li>Credit = students earn a credit when they complete a course. Some courses are worth 0.5 credits (usually), others are worth 1.0 credit. It depends on the school.</li>
            <li>Term = semester = 1 term is 4 months
                <ul>
                    <li>Fall term = September to December</li>
                    <li>Winter term = January to April</li>
                    <li>Summer term = May to August</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Our advice:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Grades 11 and 12 matter the most for getting into university</li>
            <li>To get into competitive programs, you need to have good grades AND a good resume AND references. This means doing activities outside of school, like working, volunteering, sports, leading a group, starting a business, etc.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples of competitive programs: McMaster University's Health Sciences program, medical school, pharmacy school, vet school, dental school, law school, etc.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Some schools offer <b>co-op</b> = work term during school to get experience and money. University of Waterloo is known for their co-op programs, especially in computer science. Even Microsoft and Google hire their students. They take 5 years (instead of 4) to complete, but you'll have a higher chance of getting a job after graduating because you will have experience.</li>
            <li>Many universities offer "<b>work study</b>" = jobs on campus. For example, I was a research assistant.</li>
            <li>A very important part of getting an undergrad degree is meeting new people and trying new things (like joining clubs). This is a good time to learn how to be social because it's hard to survive undergrad without friends and it's more difficult to make friends after graduating. Being social is also required to get a job!</li>
            <li>Joey recommends doing a "study abroad" or "exchange" program, where you can study in another country for 1 or 2 terms. This was her favourite part about university.</li>
        </ul>

            <li><b>OSAP</b> is a financial aid program that gives you money in two ways:
                <ol>
                    <li>Grants = money you do not have to pay back</li>
                    <li>Student loan = money you need to pay back to the government when you are done school</li>
                </ol>
            </li>    
            <li>If you apply for OSAP, the amount of money you get depends on many things, like:
                <ul>
                    <li>your program</li>
                    <li>the number of courses you take (full-time or part-time)</li>
                    <li>family income</li>
                    <li>family size</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>
            <li>The average interest rate for paying back OSAP is 2.3%. <a href = "https://osap.gov.on.ca/AidEstimator2324Web/enterapp/debt_calculator.xhtml#:~:text=Repayment%20calculator%20for%20Full%2DTime%20OSAP%20loans&text=Average%20is%20114%20months%20or%209.5%20years.&text=What%20is%20the%20interest%20rate,Average%20rate%20is%20currently%202.3%25.">Here is a calculator online</a> that calculates how much you need to pay back every month.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You can use money from your Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) to pay for your education too. We will post more information about this later.</p>
